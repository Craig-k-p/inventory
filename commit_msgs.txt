Objective:
Access containers/things from the server and present them in data rows

Created Toolbar.logObjects method
Created app.getObjects method
Created UserSession.get method
Created DataGrid.fillUserData method
Created InventoryDataRow.assignValues method
Alphabetized datagrid.py
Moved the creation of account screen Classes to kv_extensions.py -> app.createUserScreens
Integrated Database functionality with DataGrid.addDataRow, InventoryDataRow instantiation, and app.createInventoryObject

Next Goals:
	Add:
Delete object on widget deletion
	-currently widget deletes but document doesn't
	-widgets do not reappear until the program RESTARTS
	
	To Fix:

[INFO] [AUTH] [screens.py][LoginScreen.checkUserInputFormat][62] self.checkFormat DENIED asdf!
[INFO] [DB AUTH] [me_extensions.py][MyInventoryApp.authenticate][8] Checking credentials for asdf
[DEBUG] [DB Ops] [session.py][UserSession.login][216] Attempting to log asdf into the database

_getObjectCreationUserInput does not filter for "required" fields. kv_extensions.py, 386
